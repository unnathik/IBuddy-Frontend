                        <h3>Literature</h3>
                        <p>The language A: literature course introduces students to the analysis of literary texts. It is the course through which the IBâ€™s policy of mother-tongue entitlement is delivered. The course is automatically available in 55 languages and available by special request and may be studied in any language with a sufficiently developed written literature.</p>
                        <p>The course is organized into three areas of exploration and seven central concepts, and focuses on the study of literary works. Together, the three areas of exploration of the course add up to a comprehensive exploration of literature from a variety of cultures, literary forms and periods. Students learn to appreciate the artistry of literature, and develop the ability to reflect critically on their reading, presenting literary analysis powerfully through both oral and written communication.</p>

                      <h3>Language and Literature</h3>
                      <p>The language A: language and literature course introduces the critical study and interpretation of written and spoken texts from a wide range of literary forms and non literary text-types. The formal analysis of texts is supplemented by awareness that meaning is not fixed but can change in respect to contexts of production and consumption. This course is available for study in 17 languages.</p>
                      <p>The course is organized into three areas of exploration and seven central concepts, and focuses on the study of both literary or non-literary texts. Together, the three areas of exploration of the course allow the student to explore the language A in question through its cultural development and use, its media forms and functions, and its literature. Students develop skills of literary and textual analysis, and also the ability to present their ideas effectively. A key aim is the development of critical literacy.                      </p>
