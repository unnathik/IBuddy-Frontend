            <p>Creativity, Activity, Service is a mandatory core component of the IB Diploma Programme. 
              It aims to provide a 'counterbalance' to the academic rigour of the educational programme.<p>

                  the seven learning outcomes for CAS</p>
                  <br>- Hack #1: make your self a cas diary :
                  After completing a CAS experience or part of a CAS project, write down the date, activity and a few thoughts about what you did and your experience. Maybe incorporate the seven learning outcomes as guidance for what to write. By making notes in your CAS diary,  would make your  life much easier when it came to producing my detailed reflections!
                  <br><br>
                  - Hack #2 : take pictures : Including evidence is extremely essential and therefore it is important to click pictures each time you complete a cas experience! Having a separate photos folder for CAS on your phone would make things much more organised! 
                  <br><br>
                  - Hack #3: quality over quantity: cas experiences can be extremely fun if you do something you truly are passionate about. Also in terms of reflection, identifying important moments  for each experience is what is required. Some examples of such “moments” : 	
                  <br><br>•When a moment of discovery is happening<br>
                  * When a skill is mastered<br>
                  * When a challenge is confronted<br>
                  * When emotions are provoked<br>
                  * When achievement <br>
