      <p>The absolutely soul-crushing workload of IB is something that you often have to go through alone. With IBuddy, you don’t! IBuddy allows you to connect with IBDP students around the world. With this platform, your IBuddies and you get access to relevant question banks, quizzes, and other resources that will help you conquer the IB. The chat room feature also allows you and your IBuddies to keep helping and motivating each other throughout the 2 years, and even thereafter, with our “alumni-talk” chatroom.</p>
